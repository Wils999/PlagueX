This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## plagueX AI tutor setup

The tutor uses NVIDIA Build's OpenAI-compatible API through plagueX's server-side `/api/chatbot` route. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then add your NVIDIA key there. Never prefix the key with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or put it in client-side code.

```env
NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_build_api_key
# Optional: defaults to deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro
NVIDIA_MODEL=deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro
# Optional: limits a single tutor response; defaults to 1500
NVIDIA_MAX_TOKENS=1500
# Optional: NVIDIA request timeout in milliseconds; defaults to 55000
NVIDIA_TIMEOUT_MS=55000
```

The route requires an authenticated plagueX user, accepts at most 11 alternating messages of up to 4,000 characters, streams tutor responses as they are generated, times out provider connection attempts, and applies a per-instance request guard.

Students can choose Explain, Quiz Me, Flashcards, Practice Exam, Summarize, Simplify, Compare, or Step-by-Step. The selected mode is validated on the server and saved with the conversation.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
